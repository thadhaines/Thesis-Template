# Thesis-Template

A LaTeX template that makes a thesis with the following sections:
* Cover Page
* Abstract
* Dedication Page
* Acknowledgments
* Table of Contents
* List of Tables
* List of Figures
* List of Equations
* Glossary of Terms (very basic)
* Body content chapters
* Bibliography
* Appendices

The current content in the .tex files serves as a minor tutorial/reference on how to use the template. Further LaTeX information is widely available on the internet.

There are two versions of template in this repository:
* Ugly version = meets Tech requirements.
* Pretty version = subjectively nicer to look at and work in.

Use whichever version seems like a good idea...

Due to the flexibility of LaTeX, one can work in the pretty version and easily export the same report to the ugly version.

NOTE: This template is designed to be built with LuaLaTeX and use biber as a bibliography backend.
